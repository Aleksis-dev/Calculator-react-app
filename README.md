# DESCRIPTION //

This React-based calculator app allows users to input and evaluate arithmetic expressions through a clean and interactive interface. Users can click number buttons (0-9), decimal point, and basic operators (+, -, *, /) to build expressions. The app dynamically formats the expression for readability by adding thousand separators and displaying large numbers in scientific notation when needed.

Key features include:

Real-time expression formatting: Numbers in the expression are formatted with spaces as thousand separators, and very large numbers are shown using scientific notation for clarity.

Basic arithmetic evaluation: Pressing the "=" button evaluates the current expression safely. If the expression is invalid, the display shows an error message.

Clear functionality: The "C" button resets the calculator, clearing both the current expression and the display.

User-friendly display: The calculator's display updates in real-time to reflect the formatted expression or the calculated result.

This app demonstrates a combination of React state management and simple expression parsing to create a user-friendly calculator with enhanced number formatting.
